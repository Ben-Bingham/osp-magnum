/**
 * A model of deep space. This class stores the data of astronomical objects
 * represented in the universe, known as Satellites. Planets, stars, comets,
 * vehicles, etc... are all Satellites.
 *
 * This class uses EnTT ECS, where Satellites are ECS entities. Components are
 * structs prefixed with UComp.
 *
 * Satellites can have types that determine which components they have, see
 * ITypeSatellite. These types are registered at runtime.
 *
 * Positions are stored in 64-bit unsigned int vectors in UCompTransformTraj.
 * 1024 units = 1 meter
 *
 * Moving or any kind of iteration over Satellites, such as Orbits, are handled
 * by Trajectory classes, see ISystemTrajectory.
 *
 * Example of usage:
 * https://github.com/TheOpenSpaceProgram/osp-magnum/wiki/Cpp:-How-to-setup-a-Solar-System
