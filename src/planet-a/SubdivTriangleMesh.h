    //   SkeletonTriangles.

    //   shared between them. They are associated with a VrtxId in m_vrtxIdTree

    // a fixed number of mesh triangles to form most of the triangular tiling
    // of the chunk, but the triangles along the edges are specially treated as
    // a variable (but limited) number of 'Fan triangles' that may form fan-like
    // structures to smoothly transition to other chunks of a higher detail.

    // something like glMultiDrawArrays
