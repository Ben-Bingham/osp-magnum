# osp-magnum

OSP implemented 'properly' and uses Magnum Engine, roughly based on the
urho-osp repository. I hope this is a good idea :)

## Things to implement (in rough order):
* ~~Hello World, tests, and working build system~~
* ~~Simple console interface for streamlining~~
* Some Universe of Satellites
* ActiveAreas with loading. Intergrate Newton Dynamics, and make a
  SatDebugPlanet as some flat plane to test things on
* Crafts, and Loading glTF sturdies
* Terrain maybe?
