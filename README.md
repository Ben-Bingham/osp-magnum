# osp-magnum

OSP implemented 'properly' and uses Magnum Engine, roughly based on the
urho-osp repository. I hope this is a good idea :)

## Things to implement (in rough order):
* ~~Hello World, tests, and working build system~~
* ~~Simple console interface for streamlining~~
* ~~Minimal Universe of Satellites~~
* ~~Showing glTF sturdy models~~
* ActiveAreas that load nearby satellites
* Intergrate Newton Dynamics, and make a SatDebugPlanet as some flat plane to
  test things on
* Crafts that fire thrust
* Terrain maybe?

## Main Features
* 

## Notes
* 
* this project might be codenamed 'adera'. the name of the street the project
  files were first created.
